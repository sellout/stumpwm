The Stump Window Manager
------------------------

Stumpwm is a window manager written entirely in Common Lisp. It
attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the
keyboard for input. You will not find buttons, icons, title bars, tool
bars, or any of the other conventional GUI widgets.

These design decisions reflect the growing popularity of productive,
customizable lisp based systems.

Build & Start Stumpwm
---------------------

Prerequisites
=============

* a common lisp distribution.  sbcl, clisp and ccl all work.
* asdf
* clx
* cl-ppcre

sbcl and ccl are both bundled with asdf but require portable-clx and
cl-ppcre to be installed separately.  clisp (at least version 2.42
required) should be built with new-clx and requires you to install
asdf and cl-ppcre separately.

If you have previous experience with cl and asdf, you just need to
make sure that the above libraries are installed and available to
asdf.  Alternatively, your operating system distribution may have the
libraries available as packages.  Otherwise, follow the instructions
below:

 mkdir -p ~/src ~/.asdf

Install asdf (clisp only)

 cd ~/src
 wget http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.tar.gz
 tar -xzf asdf.tar.gz
 echo '(load #p"~/src/asdf/asdf")' >> ~/.clisprc.lisp

Configure asdf

sbcl: echo '(push (merge-pathnames #p".asdf/" (user-homedir-pathname)) asdf:*central-registry*)' >> ~/.sbclrc
ccl: echo '(push #p"~/.asdf/" asdf:*central-registry*)' >> ~/.ccl-init.lisp
clisp: echo '(push #p"~/.asdf/" asdf:*central-registry*)' >> ~/.clisprc.lisp

Install clx (sbcl and ccl only)

 cd ~/src
 wget http://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/lisp/sbcl/clx_0.7.3.tar.gz
 tar -xzf clx_0.7.3.tar.gz
 cd ~/.asdf && ln -s ~/src/clx_0.7.3/clx.asd

Install cl-pprce (all)

 cd ~/src
 wget http://weitz.de/files/cl-ppcre.tar.gz
 tar -xzf cl-ppcre.tar.gz
 cd ~/.asdf && ln -s ~/src/cl-ppcre/cl-ppcre.asd

Building
========

Building stumpwm from git requires that you build the configure script:

 autoconf

If there's already a configure script then just run it.

 ./configure

By default stumpwm elects sbcl.  If you have multiple lisps installed,
you can explicitly select ccl or clisp like so:

 ./configure --with-lisp=clisp
 ./configure --with-lisp=ccl

If your lisps are in strange places you may need to tell the script
where to find them:

 ./configure --with-sbcl=/home/sabetts/opt/bin/sbcl
 ./configure --with-clisp=/usr/local/downstairs/to/the/left/clisp
 ./configure --with-ccl=/somewhere/else/ccl

Now build it:

 make

If all goes well, you should have a stumpwm binary now.  You can run
the binary from where it is or install it, along with the .info
documentation, with:

 make install

Now that you have a binary, call it from your ~/.xinitrc file:

 echo /path/to/stumpwm >> ~/.xinitrc
 startx

Hopefully that will put you in X running stumpwm!

CCL And Virtual Memory
----------------------

On 64bit platforms, CCL reserves a "very large" amount of virtual
memory. If this bothers you for some reason, you can pass the -R or
--heap-reserve option to the binary in your ~/.xinitrc file. See
http://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter15.1.html for an explanation.

Help
----

There's a texinfo manual, stumpwm.texi. the build scripts generate an
info file you can read in emacs or with the `info' program.  The
manual for the latest release is available to read online at:

http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/manual/stumpwm.html

For other stuff visit the stumpwm wiki:

There's a #stumpwm channel on irc.freenode.net, too.
